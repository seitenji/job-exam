HTML Email Basics
1. Best Practices: Design
    -Emails should be 600-800 pixels maximum.
    -Design for simplicity. Use grid-based layers and avoid complicated elements that require the use of HTML floats.
    -Use basic font-family.
    -No JavaScript. GIF instead.
2. Best Practices: Development
    -Code all structure using TABLE element. For more complicated layoputs, you should nest tables to build complex structures.
    -Use element attributes(such as cellpadding, valign, and width) to set table dimensions. This forces a box-model structure.
    -Keep your CSS simple. Avoid compound style declaration, shorthand code, CSS layout properties, CSS selectors.
    -Inline all CSS.
    -No JavaScript.

Responsive Email
    -The media query's styles are nested within the emails <style> tag.
    -It's necessary for every media query style rule your write needs to be marked with a !important declaration.

CSS 
    -Use CSS2.1
    -CSS must be inlined within your HTML document.
    -Simple CSS.

HTML
    -For finer control of your HTML, try nesting <table> elements when building emails.
    -Current best practices dictate that emails should be around 600px in width, and we've found that 800px is a workable upper limit. 
    -HTML attributes, border, cellpadding, cellspacing, width, align and valign are supported in all email clients, making them ideal for settip up some baseline styling before you get into CSS.
